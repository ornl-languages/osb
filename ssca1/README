SSCA1
-----

This benchmark is based on the DARPA HPCS benchmark challenge SSCA1. In
particular, this implments SSCA1 kernel 1. Kernel 2 is also implmented for
the verification of the output of kernel 1, but is not optimized for
parallel execution.

COMPILERS
---------

This benchmark has been tested with Cray compilers using the PGI programming
environment for both MPI3 and SHMEM. GCC has been tested with OpenSHMEM-X
and OpenMPI.

INSTALL
-------

This benchmark is designed to be run from the source directory.  To build,
edit the top level Makefile to choose options. There are predefined options
for compiling with mpicc, gcc, and cray cc. There is also an option between
using -DUSE_SHMEM and -DUSE_MPI3 to select between using OpenSHMEM or MPI3
one sided operations. By default it will build the OpenSHMEM version using
cray with a gcc environment. If this is what you want, just type make. The
binary will be called ssca1.

RUNNING
-------

To run the program, use the runtime's launcher (oshrun or mpirun is typical)
as usual. The only runtime option is an environment variable called SCALE.
SCALE adjusts the size of the inputs. An input of SCALE=22 should run in
half the time as SCALE=23. The file parameters.c has some compile time
options for the Smith-Waterman algorithm such as match score and gap
penelties. Typical benchmarking usage should not modify these.

After the benchmark runs, the benchmark will display the timings for the
data generator, kernel 1, and kernel 2. The main kernel of interest is
kernel 1, since it is the one optimized with OpenSHMEM and MPI3. There will
also be verification data printed at the end. As long as the verification
sequences are found and scored correctly the benchmark is functioning
correctly.

When runnig SSCA1 the results should be similar to the following:

RESULTS NOTES
-------------

Kernel 1 is the relevant benchmark number. The Scalable Data Generator and
the Kernel 2 times are informational only. Kernel 2 verifies the results of
Kernel 1. The first three results should be, in order, "*IDENTICAL*",
*MISQRMATCHES*, *STARTGAPMIDST---END*, with scores of 55, 54, and 53
respectively. If the end result is not these values then the underlaying
implmentation of OpenSHMEM is faulty. Verifications below these sequences
are based on random chance, however they should still be in order by score.
The sort used to arrange these scores is not stable.

It should be noted, increasing the number of remote nodes while keeping
SCALE the same will result in a slow down. This is because SCALE creates a
problem size N, and each node gets M elements for M=N/n_ranks. Adding more
ranks reduces the size of M, resulting in more remote operations to complete
the benchmark. Increasing SCALE by 1 when doubling the number of ranks will
result in a similar run time.
