INSTALL
-------

In the Makefile in the top level directory there are configuration options.
If one is using `oshcc` to compile the OpenSHMEM version, no modification to
the Makefile should be required. 

The available options includes COMM, which can be selected between
`-DUSE_MPI3` to use MPI single sided communication and -DUSE_SHMEM to use
OpenSHMEM communication. There is also a compiler option, selections for
this includes mpicc, oshcc, cray, and sgi. Select the compiler appropriate
to your machine. There is also a DEBUG option.  Uncomment that line to
enable a debug build.

There is also a USE_PREFETCH option. This will use non-blocking APIs to
improve communication/computation overlap.

Typing `make -j` will build all the source and produce a final executable
called ssca1. This version of ssca1 takes no flags. The size of the problem
is controlled with the env variable SCALE. The default is 22.0. This number
is set up so that increasing the SCALE by 1 should double the execution
time, all other parameters being equal.

Kernel 1 is the relevant benchmark number. The Scalable Data Generator and
the Kernel 2 times are informational only. Kernel 2 verifies the results of
Kernel 1. The first three results should be, in order, "*IDENTICAL*",
*MISQRMATCHES*, *STARTGAPMIDST---END*, with scores of 55, 54, and 53
respectively. If the end result is not these values then the underlying
implementation of OpenSHMEM is faulty. Verifications below these sequences
are based on random chance, however they should still be in order by score.
The sort used to arrange these scores is not stable.

It should be noted, increasing the number of remote nodes while keeping
SCALE the same will result in a slow down. This is because SCALE creates a
problem size N, and each node gets M elements for M=N/n_ranks. Adding more
ranks reduces the size of M, resulting in more remote operations to complete
the benchmark. Increasing SCALE by 1 when doubling the number of ranks will
result in a similar run time.
